= chkquota

chkquota is a RFC 1870 quota check policy service. Contacted by a Postfix
check_policy_service client it will contact a remote SMTP or LMTP server. It
will specify the recipient and the current messages size to find out if the
server would accept the message for that particular recipient. Depending on the
outcome it will tell the check_policy_service client to accept or reject the
message.
